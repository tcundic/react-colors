# React color application

This application was created as exercise. It was generated with `create-react-app` command and then customized.

# Installing and running

Node proxy server is required because otherwise cors error block application from getting requests from https://www.colr.org/json/color/random.
After application is started it React will automatically open browser window and go to http://localhost:3000/.
